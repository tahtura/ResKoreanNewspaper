    <u><b>Japanese and TEI with a Post-War Historical Document</b></u>
    <p><u>Introduction</u></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px">This web page details a research assistantship undertaken by Tahura Huda Turabi, an Information Science and Japanese double-degree student
    at the University of Maryland, College Park, under the mentorship of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities. This project
    lasted the duration of the Spring 2020 semester under the course title MITH388. It explores textual scholarship of a foreign language primary
    historical document, as an effort to include both the Information Science and Japanese disciplines.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px">The text used in this research project is a representation of a text-encoded historical document from post-war Japan.
    The <i>Chousen Ryuugakusei Shimbun (朝鮮留学生新聞)</i>, held at the Gordon W. Prange Collection, University of Maryland Libraries,
    is a newspaper published by study-abroad Korean Students in Kobe, Japan, in the years following World War II. This particular document was published in October 1947, and
    concerns several topics including US-Russian influence in Korea, Korean unification, resisting imperialism, and the role of students in Korean independence.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px">The student authors often refer to themselves as "Zainichi Chousenjin," or "Resident Koreans." Resident Koreans in Japan
    are residents of Korean descent who are not considered national citizens, despite often having lived in the country
    for generations beginning in the war period. Due to devastating conditions both before and during the war, many Koreans
    immigrated to Japan in search of work and a better chance for survival. Unfortunately, they faced discrimination and hardship
    as a minority. Today, the term "Zainichi Kankokujin" ("Kankoku", 韓国, being the modern equivalent to "Chousen,"朝鮮, both meaning
    "Korea" in Japanese) is still politically charged as the minority continues to call for equal rights, such as the right to vote.</p>

    <p><u>Project Background</u></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px">This newspaper record was initially in physical format. The collection holder, the Gordon W. Prange Collection, University of Maryland Libraries,
    scanned the pages of the newspaper and digitized it as high-quality TIFF files. The text was then transcribed and translated by hand into Japanese text, preserving historical
    uses of Kanji and Kana. It was then annotated with oXygen XML Editor and Atom programs using standards from the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). TEI is a specific practice
    within the Digital Humanities field that typically focuses on examining and analyzing textual materials. Using XML code, important aspects of a text are "tagged" with elements.
    For example, if a famous historical figure's name were to appear in a text, it could be tagged with the Person Name element "persName". An example of the XML code would be: </p>
    <code>
      A man named &#60;persName>Abraham Lincoln&#60;/persName>.
    </code>
    <br/><br/>
    For more information on the TEI elements used to annotate this document, please see the <a href="data/schema/tei_jp.odd">TEI ODD documentation</a>
    <br/>
    <p><u>Text Legend</u></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px">Given the many TEI elements used to indicate aspects of the text such as organization names, historical spelling, and more, CSS was used
    to color code the text by their tags. The colors are represented as written below:</p>
    <p style="color:#FA020B">Distinct (Archaic Kanji usage): Red</p>
    <p style="color:#0071bc">Distinct (Historical Kana spelling): Blue</p>
    <p style="color:#8B008B">Distinct (Unknown Kanji Compound, suspected Hanja): Dark Magenta</p><br/>
    <p style="color:#CD6714">Person Name: Dark Orange</p>
    <p style="color:#EC1D98">Organization Name: Dark Pink</p>
    <p style="color:#753030">Plan Name: Brown<p/><br/>
    <p style="color:#4c2c92">Date: Purple<p/>
    <p style="color:#2e8540">Places (Address, Place Name, Country): Green<p/><br/>

    <p><u>Text Introduction</u></p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px">Below is the full text of the first page of the <i>Chousen Ryuugakusei Shimbun</i> published on October 20th, 1947. After the title, header,
    and publishing information, there are three main articles. Within each article are several sub-articles, noted by their vertically-oriented titles. This text is marked
    by color, as indicated by the legend above. After the Japanese text is a rough translation of the first main article. Due to time
    constraints of the project, the first article has a rough English translation provided. Future directions for this work could include additional translation work, matching
    TEI of the English translation for better comprehension by non-Japanese speakers, providing links that give additional information for certain tagged elements such as
    biographies for persons whose names appear, and refining TEI elements to best describe the piece in both syntactic and historically contextual senses.</p>

    <br/><u>An Autumn of Independence</u><br/><br/>

    <p><b>The Marshall Plan and Withdrawal Proposal / Will the Provisional Government Exist within a Few Months?
    If reunified, is independence possible?</b></p>

    <p>Previously the US and the Soviet Union, in a joint committee, made a great effort in order to establish a provisional government for Korean unification, though executing such a
      mission entirely proved impossible. Now, with the US, the Shikoku Proposal for independence presented to the UN was finally approved by 12 points at the UN Committee meeting on
      September 21st. At that time, the Soviet Union proposed to the joint committee that they both withdraw their troops from Korea simultaneously.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in New York City on the 7th via an AP dispatch, the United Nations General Assembly finally finished the plan to establish a framework for self-independence
      under UN surveillance within a number of months based on the Marshall Plan. According to the declaration made by those associated with the US diplomatic mission, as the US makes
      this plan concretely apparent, part of the responsibility to decide at what stage the US-Soviet occupying forces should withdraw from Korea will be shared with the UN and Korea.
      Aside from the particulars, this plan was almost completed.</p>

    <p>Additionally, according to a statement by Mr. Tom Lambert at Keijou, there is no doubt that if Korea was to be unified, the industries of the North and the agriculture of the South
       would be naturally tied together, and various problems would be quickly resolved. The history of the US government, after examining both Korea’s economic strength in waiting and its
       economic achievements under Japanese rule, has assessed that a unified Korea would have the resources and manpower to sufficiently support itself. This would require direct economic,
       technical, and administrative support from a reliable government.</p>

    <br/>


    <b>New US Proposal</b>

    <p>The new US proposal stated earlier is outlined below.</p>

    <p>On the occasion of the election of the Korean National Congress, the UN Committee will be present as an observer. The American government authorities would like to try to do this within
      the next 6 months.</p>

    <p>One, The Korean provisional government will be selected by the UN General Assembly, and both aid and support can be requested for that same government by the United Nations.</p>

    <p>One, The realization of the US-Soviet plan for the troop withdrawal stage will be agreed upon by the US, Soviet Union, and Korea, as a three party pact at a meeting held by the UN.</p>

    <br/>


    <b>The Soviet Withdrawal Plan</b>

    <p>On the occasion of a Cooperative Committee being opened on September 26th due to a Soviet representative of the US-Soviet Committee, after a proposal was made to withdraw both armies
      simultaneously, a reporter stated in an interview that “The Korean people hope that, just like with the establishment of the Democratic provisional government, the standing Soviet army dividing
      the North and South will withdraw. Now, conquering the Korean people’s confusion and achieving the stage of an autonomous provisional government, the demand for the withdrawal of both the US and
      the Soviet Union is absolute.”</p>

    <br/>


    <b>☆South Korean Opposition/North Korean Approval</b>

    <p>In North Korea, each political party and societal organizations  including the North Korean Labor Party announced on the 27th that US representatives have no reason to reject the Soviet
    representatives’ full endorsement of (shoumyou).</p>

    <p>In response to that, South Korean right-wing elder politician, namely, Dr. Syngman Rhee, who continually insisted on the withdrawal of the invading occupying army, says that “There is no
    way to say that the US will concede the road to the Soviet Union.” In addition, Mr. Kyu-sik Kim also opposes this, and advocates that in the case that withdrawal occurs, they ought to train
    in weaponry and military against North Korean forces.</p>

    <br/>


    <b>Mr. Yong-jeung Kim (President of the Korean Affairs Institute)<br/>
    Five Small Countries Commission Proposal</b>

    <p>On the other hand, according to a Washington DC report on the 30th, Mr. Yong-jeung Kim, President of the Korean Affairs Institute, proposed to the US Government a simultaneous withdrawal from Korea.
     He says, “The Soviet Union must, according to the Five Small Countries Commission appointed by the UN, be under complete surveillance to leave behind no weapons, or a civil war may occur in Korea.
     Before the withdrawal of troops from the US-Soviet boundary begins, the border must be opened for the sake of the Korean people maintaining their own order. If the Soviet Union, as in the past, is
     hoping for the happiness of the Korean people, they would surely accept this.” Mr. Kim’s proposed surveillance committee would attempt to add the Philippines or Siam from Asia, Norway or Sweden from
     Europe, Australia or New Zealand, and also one from the North and South Americas like Mexico or Canada. Additionally, the Soviet Union and the United States must maintain neutrality without interfering
     in Korean domestic affairs, and pledge to the United Nations that together with the United Kingdom and China they will assure Korea’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Mr. Kim’s assertion quite
     frankly represents our feelings on the subject, as we attempt to assert that Korea is a country that has been liberated.</p>

     <br/>


    <b>Resident Korean Students of Japan<br/>
    Social Thought Forum</b>

    <p>The fifth Resident Korean Student Social Thought Forum was held on September 27th at the Kyoto Academy Chūbu Headquarters.</p>

    <p>About 150 representatives from every district freely attended the debate, and students rushed into the practical competition for the purpose of exhausting firm resolutions for the reconstruction of the motherland,
    and adjourned.  The debate matters are as to the left:</p>

    <p>1) Analysis of the Postwar International Situation<br/>
    1 The Relative Weakening of the Capitalist System<br/>
    2 The Increase in Power of Democratic Revolution<br/>
    3 Intensification of the National Liberation Movement of Colonies and Semi-Colonies<br/>
    4 Intensification of the American Labor Movement and the Rise of Reactionary Influence<br/>
    5 Will the Soviet Union Guarantee World Peace?</p>

    <p>2) The International Situation and Independence<br/>
    1 Defeating the Remains of International Facsism<br/>
    2 The Complete Implementation of the  “Cairo, Potsdam Three-Phase Agreements” International Treaty<br/>
    3 Political Power is in the Hands of the People (The People’s Committee)<br/>
    4 The Immediate Release of Unlawful Oppressed, Arrested Patriots</p>

    <p>3) The Many Problems of Resident Korean Compatriots<br/>
    1 Assertively Driving the Korean Movement<br/>
    2 Developing Cooperation and Joint Struggle with Japan’s Democratic Power<br/>
    3 Demolishing The Surviving Influence of Japanese Imperialism and Reactionary Profiteers</p>

    <p>4) The Mission of Resident Korean Students<br/>
    1 Students Directly Facing Reality and Investigating the Truth in Order to Increase Reciprocation of Theory and Standards<br/>
    2 Assertive Development of a Democratic Movement within Schools<br/>
    3 Joining the Enlightenment of Resident Compatriots</p>

    <p>Without dismissing the above conclusions as merely a fanciful theoretical discussion, the decision to fight with direct, practical actions was made.</p>

    <b>PEN</b>

    <p>△Napoleon once stated that the word “impossible” is not in the dictionary. Literary master André Maurois similarly said, “If what you want is possible, you can achieve it, and if it is impossible, then
      it will simply take a little more time. With just some time and patience, nothing is impossible.” △ For the sake of creating eternal peace, famous physicians from every country gathered at the United Nations.
      It was as if twins were born, but it seems that regarding methods as far as self-actualization goes, identical opinions have been discovered. However, the situation is that there is still the challenge of the
      environment being too hot or too cold. Despite this, many physicians will likely find a better environment and position. △In particular, many physicians concerned with our country changing its colors at the
      38°N Latitude are making diagnoses. However, too many diagnoses could confuse us, and moreover make the condition worse. A better diagnosis would by no means indicate a division, and would rather allow for unification.
      The history of the past 36 years clearly demonstrates to us that this is possible. Making a diagnosis by looking at just the surface proves nothing except that these doctors are quacks.</p>
